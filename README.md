### Spotted

An application that I will be developing with my friend. Dealing with personal car profiles, specifying modifications made to the car. See a car, scan the car, get everything that car owner wants to share about that car.

## Edmunds API

We will be using the [Edmunds][edmunds] API for getting stock car information.

# Phase 1

Vehicle profiles. Upload a vehicle, add modifications to that vehicle, modifications change stock values of car specs, upload picture of the vehicle. Supports performance and aesthetic modifications. Picture gallery for everything.

# Phase 1.1

IOS application for the car profile website. Search database of vehicles, display vehicles. Manage your own vehicles.

# Phase 2

NFC or RFID integration to link to vehicle profiles.
